# A small crate for emitting C code

Currently handles a subset of C99. Handles some pretty nasty variable
declarations that nest arrays with function pointers.

Before this gets published on crates.io, I'd like to add more C99
coverage along with some fuzzy testing.

Pull requests are encouraged :)
